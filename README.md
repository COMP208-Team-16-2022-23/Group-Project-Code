## Creating an environment from a yaml file

You can find the YAML file `environment.yml` [here](./misc/conda_env_config). Please refer to
the [instructions](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file)
to create the environment.

Please remember
to [update the YAML file](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-file-manually)
after installing new python packages.

### Advice

Think twice before git PUSH.
